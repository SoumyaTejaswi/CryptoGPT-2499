CryptoGPT - Your Secure Chat Companion

CryptoGPT is a simple GUI application built with Python's Tkinter library that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using various cryptographic algorithms. Additionally, it integrates OpenAI's GPT-2 model to provide suggestions for encryption and decryption based on user input.

Features:
User-friendly interface for encryption and decryption of messages.
Supports multiple cryptographic algorithms including AES, DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish.
Provides intelligent suggestions for encryption and decryption using OpenAI's GPT-2 model.
Encryption algorithms use standard padding techniques for secure message handling.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Crypto library (install via pip install pycryptodome)
transformers library (install via pip install transformers)
tkinter library (should be included in Python standard library)
Internet connection (for GPT-2 model usage)

Usage:
Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the app.py script to launch the CryptoGPT application.
- Enter the plaintext or ciphertext and the encryption/decryption key.
- Select the encryption/decryption mode and algorithm from the dropdown menus.
- Click the "Submit" button to perform the encryption or decryption operation.
- View the output in the designated text area and follow any suggestions provided by the GPT-2 model.
